BM-HTML-Yield
=============

 Chrome Extension for generation of HTML Output from Debugger.
 
#Problem:

There is no way in BM to look at HTML output generated unless you are in BM Popup window. In config, BM Utils and Commerce Lib's there ain't a facility. The following chrome extension does these wonders with single click.

## 1) 
**(Please check screen shot below), there is no way to check whether this html code works from debugger unless you copy paste code in another app/test it from system.**
**But the attached Chrome Extension solves the problem.**
